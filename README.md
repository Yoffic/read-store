# Book Store

This is a simple SPA bookstore catalog with cart page. Watch how the App works [here](https://yoffic.github.io/read-store).

I used React, Redux and React Router to create the SPA. There is an ability to add items to cart. Positions in the cart could be increased, decreased or deleted. I used custom data in the project. There could be occasionally displayed an error message which I added to demonstrate the case that the data hasn't loaded. I also added a loading indicator for the case the data has loaded with the delay.

For styling I used Bootstrap 4, Fontawesome and Google Fonts.
